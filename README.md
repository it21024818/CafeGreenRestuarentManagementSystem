# Cafe Green Restuarant Management System

Café Green is a popular restaurant situated in the center of the Colombo district. The café is daily 
visited by many customers. They provide services such as dine-in, takeaway and delivery of 
various food items.
In this café, the management and staff are managing all their processes such as employee
management, supplier management, order management, financial accounts management, etc.
manually. Hence, the entire productivity of the restaurant is inadequate, and costly. In addition, 
the data of financial accounts and other important information is at risk of data loss.
Therefore, we developed a web application for this cafeteria to do their essential
tasks more conveniently and productively. Almost all their specific tasks will be automated by 
deploying this system. Thus, it will deduct the number of employees which in return, will reduce 
the cost of the salaries. Furthermore, the system will expand the customer experience, and attract 
new customers. In conclusion, both the management and customers will benefit from this system.
